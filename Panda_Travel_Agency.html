			<li><b><i>Shannon Washington</i></b> I came here with my family last summer, and we enjoyed it immensely! We are from Oklahoma in the U.S., so we weren't really acquainted to beaches...let alone green ones! Rocks were beautiful and the green sand was really something special. Looking to come back soon! <b>Rate: 5 out of 5 stars</b></li>
			<li><b><i>Mike Thomason</b></i> Nice beach, but I did <b>not</b> enjoy the sunburn...so here's a lesson for anyone looking to travel here: Pack some sunscreen! Pretty basic advice for any beach, but besides that I had a grand time. <b>Rate: 4 out of 5 stars</b></li>
			<li><b><i>Emily Green</i></b> I am in LOVE with this beach...came here two months ago with a few of my girlfriends and it was one of the most amazing beaches I have visited my entire life. We went right after college graduation as we were traveling around French Guiana and it was absolutely amazing. I recommend this beach to anyone...families, groups of friends, anyone! <b>Rate: 5 out of 5 stars</b></li>
